A mod tool for Minecraft Wii U Edition

This is a tool I started developing in september 2020. I wanted to make a program which has all the mods I need for Minecraft Wii U. Some mods are skidded and others I made myself but I tried crediting all the people that I used the work from. The code is messy and not the best.
I gave up on this project since Minecraft Wii U Edition is very dead.
